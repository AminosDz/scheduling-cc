abstract: >-
  Parallel machine scheduling problems are among the most studied scheduling
  problems in the literature.  We study the unrelated parallel machine
  scheduling problem with release dates and machine- and sequence-dependent
  setup times to minimize the makespan. We introduce three heuristics, five
  local search methods and three metaheuristics for the problem: the Late
  Acceptance Hill Climbing and two variants of Simulated Annealing. Furthermore,
  we introduce a three-set 1620-instance benchmark in which the number of jobs
  and machines, release dates, processing and setup times are generated
  according to existing procedures. The proposed approaches are analyzed and
  compared on the proposed benchmark. We compare the proposed heuristics and
  derive the best heuristic to be used to generate the initial solution of the
  metaheuristics. 

  Moreover, we show that the different metaheuristics are efficient, each performing best on one of the sets.
